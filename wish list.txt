What do you want the RaBIDS program to do in future?

v0.1

Chris Paret, 2020/03/01

Import and Preprocessing: Voxel displacement maps not implemented, yet

Preprocessing: 
- Anatomical normalization is done for each scan separately - even if two functional scans were recorded in the same session. This could become more efficient.
- Parameters are currently set to standard PSM sequence (36 slices, 2s TR). This could become more flexible in future
- Smoothing is set to 8mm, might become more flexible

Firstlevel: Analysis of multiple runs with same conditions is currently not implemented

Others:
- test compatibility with fmriPrep and fmriQC
- add tool to fill the dataset_description.json with study information
