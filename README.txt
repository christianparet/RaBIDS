Description:
RaBIDS is Matlab-based software supporting the import of human neuroimaging data to the BIDS format (visit https://bids.neuroimaging.io/ for information on BIDS). The vision of this project is to provide a tool that researchers without a programming background, used to work with Windows Apps, can pick up easily. In its current version RaBIDS uses Excel-based tables to load experiment information that is used to assign scans to tasks. In future, Excel will not be used anymore and all routines will be implemented in a Matlab GUI.
There are several limitations regarding software versions that might prevent users to use RaBIDS v0.2. Please consult the manual for more information.

This project is currently under development. To work with RaBIDS, go to the recent version directory (denoted vX.X, e.g. v0.2) and read the manual. A tutorial is provided. Data for this tutorial can be requested from the author.
