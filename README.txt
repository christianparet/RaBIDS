RaBIDS
Rapid and automated Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) conversion

Description: RaBIDS is Matlab-based software supporting the import of human neuroimaging data to the BIDS format (visit https://bids.neuroimaging.io/ for information on BIDS). The Import part of RaBIDS can be regarded as a wrapper built around the dicm2nii toolbox (https://github.com/xiangruili/dicm2nii). The Create-SOTs part provides an automatized routine to read stimulus onset times from the experiment logfile. The vision of this project is to provide a tool to researchers without programming background who are used to work in a Windows environment. In its current version (v0.X), RaBIDS uses Excel-2010-based tables to load experiment information that is used to assign scans to tasks. In future, Excel will not be used anymore and all routines will be implemented in a Matlab GUI.
There are several limitations and software requirements that might prevent users from using the current beta version v0.2.X. Please consult the manual for more information.
This project is currently under development. Before using RaBIDS please consult the manual. A tutorial is provided. Data for this tutorial can be requested from the author.

Make sure to use the latest release, which is currently v0.2.2.
